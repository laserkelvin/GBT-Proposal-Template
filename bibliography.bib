Anion abundances in low and mid-mass regions were previously reproduced fairly well by models. High-mass regions, however, were not well-reproduced.

One of the major sources of anion destruction in the gas phase is atomic oxygen.  In these higher density regions, these atoms are accreted onto the grain surfaces where they can't react to destroy the anions in the gas phase.

This new model much better reproduces the abundances in the gas phase.}
